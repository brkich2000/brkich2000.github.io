			<h1>More than 8.7 million adult</h1>
			<h1>Australians do not hold a Will</h1>
			<p>The top 3 reasons for not having a Will; 
			<ul>		
				<li>- they do not feel they have sufficient assets to pass on </li>
				<li>- Estate Planning costs too much money</li>
				<li>- a Will is for old people</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Since over 60% of all Australians do not hold a Will they risk a stranger deciding who should receive their assets and could result in families being torn apart or contesting the outcomes which means more cost and pain for everyone involved. Reel releases the video Will to the selected executors upon proof of death to ensure probate can be a quick and easy process to users estates being passed on in accordance with their wishes.</p>
